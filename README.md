# Text_Adventure2.0
## Description
Go on a thrilling text adventure where your goal is to explore, interact and discover new places and items. TIn this captivating game, we have seamlessly blended the elements of exploration, puzzle-solving, and decision-making to create an immersive and entertaining experience like no other. Our primary objective in developing this game was to provide you, the player, with a delightful and engaging user experience while simultaneously gaining valuable insights into the intricacies of full-stack applications and game development.

Developing this text adventure game came with many challenges as this is our first time developing a front and back end application. We used new APIs and frameworks that are new to us. Also timing how and when certain parts of the project would be done in order to advance another. As we continue to refine and expand our project, we strive to enhance its features and incorporate additional elements that will captivate and captivate players even further.

## Usage
1.) You start by either making an account or logging in. Home Page 2.) If you do not have an account you enter a username, email and password. Sign up form 3.) Finally you log in and start your taken to the user dashboard. User Dashboard

At your dashboard you able to start a new adventure or continue an existing one. If the user does not have a current adventure in progress we just leave a blank space there. Users are limited to one adventure at time. If the user attempts to start a new adventure with a current one in progress the adventure in progress is deleted.

New Story character selection screen

Assuming users start a new adventure they are given four characters to chosse from. Each character has the same stats so for the most part you are just picking a character. One thing to mention here is the images included in the web application. The images are made given an api call to our application. Right now there is one function to make a given image in the original_image folder to a 200 x 200 pixles image which is saved to output folder.

Story page with associated story options

Then once you choose a character you are taken to a page where you begin your journey as seen above. The amount of options you can choose from will vary depending on the story. Eventually you will make it to a procced to ending button to end this adventure. Another thing to mention here is that the user has there progress saved as soon as they click on an option. The user can logout and not worry about starting over progress is saved.

Ending screen for users

Here at the very end there is not much just an ending screen with a home button to return users to their dashboard. This page is not developed fully this is one area of improvement. We could give users a unique acheviment, remove this page, or something of the sorts. All the story, character, and other information tied to the story is predefined. If anyone wanted to update the game with new information it would require us to take down everything and do it on the back end. data This concludes this project.
